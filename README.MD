# bclean - Remove unused build files
bclean is a command line tool for identifying and removing wasted disk space caused by build artefacts. It is available for a variety of development languages.

## Features
- Automatically identify build / cache files from the following languages / tools
  - Rust (`target`)
  - Node (`node_modules`)
  - CMake (`cmake-build-[debug,release,relwithdebinfo,minsizerel]`)
- Advanced filter to avoid recently used projects

## Motivation
If you work on a lot of different projects, over time your hard drive will fill up with various build and cache files. These files can add up to tens of gigabytes over time, especially for some development languages. 
Not only do these files take up disk space, they also need to be backed up every time you back up your PC. 
With `bclean` you can easily identify these folders and files globally on your PC and easily delete them, reducing disk usage and backup times.

## Contributing
All contributions are highly appreciated. Starting from fixing a type up to adding new providers to support cleaning other build files of other languages / tools.
